# sil-core
sil-core - core for 'sil' system libraries

# goal
I want to import my PySil library to other programming languages,

and this is an open source core for all of these libraries,

so if you want to make one yourself, below is the tutorial how to do so.

# usage
  - put the core folder into your library
  - create a library in your desired language
  - for each library function assign one function file from core folder ( there are tools to run pyhton files for example in java jython )
  - done!

# other
If you are going to publish your library anywhere,
in the description/docs/wiki you have to include me as core creator and put a link to this sil-core project
